## 🚨 Contribution Rules (Strict Enforcement)

> **Read this section carefully before doing anything. Violations will result in your PR being closed without review.**

- ❌ **Do NOT open PRs for issues unless you are officially assigned**
- ❌ **Do NOT create new issues** - issues are created and managed only by organizers
- ❌ **PRs without a linked issue (or team number) will be closed immediately**
- ❌ **PRs for unassigned issues will be closed without merging**
- ❌ **Do NOT self-assign issues**
- ✅ **One issue per contributor at a time** - finish and submit before picking another
- ✅ **Only maintainers can assign, review, and merge PRs** - do not ask others to merge your PR
- ✅ **Every PR must include your Team Number** in the description
- ✅ **General improvement PRs** (bug fixes or enhancements outside existing issues) are allowed but reviewed strictly - you must still include your team number and clearly explain the change

---

## 📌 Issue Policy

- Issues are **created and managed only by organizers** - do not open your own issues
- To work on an issue, **comment on it requesting assignment** (e.g., *"I'd like to work on this, Team XX"*)
- **Wait for a maintainer to officially assign you** before writing any code
- Once assigned, you must submit your PR within **3-5 days** or the issue will be reassigned
- If you're stuck or unavailable, **comment on the issue** so maintainers can help or reassign

## 🚀 Reporting Bugs or Proposing Improvements

As part of this competition, **participants are not permitted to create new issues** in the repository.

If you identify:

- A functional bug  
- A UI/UX inconsistency  
- A documentation error  
- A minor or major enhancement  
- A refactor that improves code quality or maintainability  

You must **submit a Pull Request directly**.

### 📌 Important Guidelines

- ❌ Do **not** open a new issue for such findings.  
- ✅ Submit a Pull Request with a clear and structured description.  
- ✅ Include your **Team Number** in the PR description.  
- ✅ Clearly explain the problem and the rationale behind your proposed change.  
- ✅ Attach screenshots if the change affects UI.  

These submissions will be treated as **General Improvement Pull Requests** and will undergo **strict review** to ensure:

- Relevance to project scope  
- Code quality and maintainability  
- No unintended side effects  
- Compliance with project standards  

Maintainers reserve the right to close any PR that is:

- Trivial or low-effort  
- Outside the intended scope  
- Poorly documented  
- Not aligned with repository standards  

Please ensure that your contribution is meaningful, well-tested, and professionally presented.

## 💻 Development Workflow

### 1. Branch Naming Convention

Always work on a new branch. Never push directly to `main`.

* `feature/` (e.g., `feature/add-multi-pdf-support`)
* `fix/` (e.g., `fix/sidebar-overlap`)
* `docs/` (e.g., `docs/update-installation-steps`)

### 2. Commit Format

We follow the **Conventional Commits** standard:

* `feat:` — A new feature
* `fix:` — A bug fix
* `docs:` — Documentation only changes
* `refactor:` — Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

---
